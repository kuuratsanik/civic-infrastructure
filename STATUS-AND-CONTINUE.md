## 🚀 OPTION 1 IN PROGRESS: Continue Phase 2

### Achievements So Far

**Created**:

- ✅ Deploy-FullPower-Governed.ps1 (248 lines)
- ✅ PHASE-2-READY.md (deployment guide)
- ✅ Evidence bundle structure

**Tested**:

- ✅ Governance wrapper executed
- ✅ Deployment logged to blockchain
- ✅ Evidence bundle created
- ⚠️ Minor issues discovered (fixing now)

### Issues Discovered

**Issue 1**: Chain Linking Bug

```
Record #0: previous_hash = 0000...0000 ✅
Record #1: previous_hash = 0000...0000 ❌ (should be 1ca2bbda...)
```

**Root Cause**: Add-CouncilLedgerEntry.ps1 not correctly reading previous record

**Impact**: Medium - ledger integrity verification fails

**Status**: Identified, fix in progress

**Issue 2**: Read-Host Syntax

```powershell
Read-Host "Approve deployment? (yes/no)"  # ❌ PowerShell interprets (yes/no) as command
```

**Fix**: Change to:

```powershell
Read-Host "Approve deployment (yes/no)"   # ✅ Works correctly
```

---

## 🔧 FIXES BEING APPLIED

### Fix 1: Update Add-CouncilLedgerEntry.ps1

**Problem**: Not reading previous records correctly from JSONL format

**Solution**: Properly parse JSONL (each line is separate JSON)

**Test**: Add new entry and verify chain links correctly

### Fix 2: Update Deploy-FullPower-Governed.ps1

**Problem**: Read-Host prompt syntax error

**Solution**: Remove parentheses from prompt

**Test**: Re-run local deployment

## 📊 CURRENT LEDGER STATE

```json
Record #0:
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-17T02:45:00+03:00",
  "action": "Project Resumption",
  "actor": "GitHub Copilot",
  "previous_hash": "0000...0000",
  "record_hash": "1ca2bbda...",
  "record_index": 0
}

Record #1:
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-17T02:50:58+03:00",
  "action": "Wave 9 Deployment Failed",
  "actor": "svenk",
  "previous_hash": "0000...0000",  ← WRONG (should be 1ca2bbda...)
  "record_hash": "86f3fafa...",
  "record_index": 1  ← MISSING
}
```

**After fix** → Record #1 will correctly link to Record #0

## ✅ WHAT'S WORKING

**Governance Wrapper**:

- ✅ Deployment initiation logged
- ✅ Deployment result logged (even failures!)
- ✅ Evidence bundle created
- ✅ Unique deployment ID generated
- ✅ Transcript captured
- ✅ Error handling works

**Evidence Bundle**:

```
evidence/deployments/wave9-20251017-025058/
├── manifest.json              ✅ Created
├── deployment-transcript.log  ✅ Created
└── deployment-error.txt       ✅ (if errors)
```

**Blockchain Ledger**:

- ✅ Records being added
- ✅ Hashes being calculated
- ⚠️ Chain linking needs fix
- ✅ Verification script works
