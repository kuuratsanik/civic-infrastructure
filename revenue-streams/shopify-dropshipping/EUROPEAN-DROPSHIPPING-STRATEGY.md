## Critical EU Compliance (Non-Negotiable)

### IOSS Registration (Mandatory)

What: Import One-Stop Shop (VAT collection system)
Why: Customers avoid surprise customs fees

Cost: Free registration, ~€50 setup time
Process: 1. Register business at emta.ee/ioss
  2. Get IOSS number (IM format)

  4. Include in supplier invoices
  5. Monthly VAT declaration (automatic via Shopify)

Without IOSS: 80% cart abandonment on non-EU orders
With IOSS: <5% cart abandonment
```

### Consumer Rights (14-Day Return Policy)

```
EU Directive 2011/83/EU Requirements:
- 14-day no-questions-asked return window
- Clear pre-purchase disclosure
- Return shipping: Customer pays (state clearly)

## Supply Chain Architecture

### Tier 1: EU Suppliers (70% of catalog)

**Goal**: 3-7 day delivery to any EU address

| Platform    | Location               | Shipping | Integration    | Best For             |
| ----------- | ---------------------- | -------- | -------------- | -------------------- |
| **Spocket** | Multiple EU warehouses | 2-5 days | Native Shopify | General products     |
| **BigBuy**  | Spain                  | 3-7 days | API            | Electronics, home    |
| **vidaXL**  | Netherlands            | 4-6 days | CSV import     | Furniture, outdoor   |
| **Syncee**  | EU network             | 3-6 days | Native Shopify | Fashion, accessories |

**Setup**:

```powershell
# Install Spocket
Shopify Admin → Apps → Spocket
Filter: "Ships from: European Union"
Import: 10-15 products initially (test batch)

# Pricing Formula
Supplier Cost × 2.5 = Retail Price
Example: €20 → €50 (€30 margin covers ads + Shopify fees)
```

### Tier 2: Premium China (20% of catalog)

**Goal**: Unique products not available in EU, 7-14 day delivery

```yaml
Platform: CJDropshipping
Shipping Method: "CJ Packet Sensitive" (7-12 days to EU)
IOSS Integration: Mandatory (CJ supports this)
Best For: High-margin novelty items (€40+ retail)

Quality Control:
- Order sample to Estonian address
- Verify actual delivery time
- Check packaging quality
- Test IOSS VAT handling
```

### Tier 3: Hybrid Model (10% of catalog)

**Goal**: Stock bestsellers locally for 1-2 day delivery

```powershell
# After 90 days, identify top 3 products
Shopify Analytics → Reports → Products by Units Sold

# Bulk Order Strategy
Order 50-100 units of top product
Store at:
  - Your address (if space available)
  - 3PL partner (e.g., ShipBob Tallinn warehouse)

Margin Boost:
  EU Dropship: €30 margin
  Local Stock: €42 margin (save supplier markup)

Competitive Advantage:
  "Delivered in 24-48 hours across Estonia/Finland"
```

---

## Store Optimization Framework

### Visual Excellence Checklist

```
Product Page Must-Haves:
□ 6-8 high-resolution images (white background + lifestyle)
□ 15-30 second video (problem → solution → benefit)
□ 5+ customer reviews with photos (use Loox)
□ Trust badges (SSL, money-back guarantee, EU-based)
□ Size/dimension charts (reduce returns)
□ "Ships from EU" badge (custom HTML)

Tools:
- Canva Pro: €11/month (product graphics)
- CapCut: Free (product videos)
- Loox: Auto-request photo reviews
```

### Mobile-First Design (78% of EU traffic)

```yaml
Theme: Dawn (free, fast, modern)
Speed Target: <2 seconds load time

Optimization:
  - Compress images: TinyPNG.com
  - Lazy loading: Enabled by default in Dawn
  - Remove unused apps: Check Shopify speed score
  - Mobile test: Use Google PageSpeed Insights

Conversion Killers: ❌ Complicated checkout
  ❌ Slow image loading
  ❌ Unclear shipping costs
  ❌ No mobile payment options (Apple Pay/Google Pay)
```

### Localization Strategy

```powershell
# Shopify Markets Setup
Settings → Markets → Add Market

Priority Markets:
1. Germany (largest EU e-commerce)
2. France (high fashion/lifestyle spend)
3. Netherlands (early adopters)
4. Austria (high purchasing power)
5. Finland (cross-border from Estonia)

Per Market:
□ Professional translation (NOT Google Translate)
  Tool: Weglot (€9.90/month) or hire on Upwork
□ Local currency (EUR already set)
□ Local payment methods:
  - Germany: Klarna, SOFORT
  - Netherlands: iDEAL
  - All: PayPal, credit cards
□ Market-specific domain:
  - beststore.de (Germany)
  - beststore.fr (France)
```

## Marketing Machine (AI-Delegated)

### Organic Content (€0 cost, 60% of initial traffic)

**TikTok Strategy**:

```yaml
Format: "Problem-Solution" videos (7-15 seconds)
Posting: 2-3 videos/day
Hashtags: #[ProductName] #[Problem] #[CountryTikTok]
  Example: #BackPain #ErgoChair #GermanyTikTok

Video Scripts (Test These):
1. "POV: You finally found [solution] for [problem]"
2. "If you have [problem], you NEED this"
3. "I tested 5 [products], here's the winner"

Tools:
- CapCut (editing)
- Trending sounds (search TikTok Creative Center)
- Hook in first 1 second (fast-paced visual)

Success Metric: 1 viral video (100k+ views) = 50-200 orders
```

**Instagram Reels**:

```
Same content as TikTok, cross-post
Add: Link in bio → Linktree → Shopify store
Engage: Reply to ALL comments within 2 hours
Stories: Daily behind-scenes, product demos
```

### Paid Advertising (After €1,000 organic revenue)

**Meta Ads (Facebook/Instagram)**:

```powershell
# Budget Allocation
Testing Phase (Days 1-14): €10-15/day
Scaling Phase (Days 15-30): €30-50/day if ROAS >2.5

# Campaign Structure
Campaign: Sales (Conversions)
Ad Set: Broad targeting
  - Location: Germany (start with ONE country)
  - Age: 25-55
  - Interest: Let algorithm find (Advantage+ audience)

Ad Creative:
  - Format: Video (15-30 sec)

Success Metrics:
  - CTR: >1.5%
  - CPC: <€0.50
  - ROAS: >2.5 (€2.50 revenue per €1 ad spend)

```

**TikTok Ads** (Higher ROI, younger audience):

```yaml
Minimum Budget: €20/day
Creative: Native content (NOT polished ads)
Targeting: Automatic (TikTok's algorithm is excellent)
Format: Spark Ads (boost your organic viral posts)

Advantage: Lower CPC (€0.15-0.30) vs Meta (€0.40-0.70)
```

**Google Shopping** (High-Intent Buyers):

```
Setup: Google Merchant Center → Link Shopify

## Common Pitfalls (Avoid These)

### ❌ DON'Ts

1. **Don't ignore IOSS** - You'll lose 80% of customers
2. **Don't use China-only suppliers** - 30-day shipping kills EU conversions
3. **Don't skip sample ordering** - Low quality = bad reviews = death
4. **Don't translate with Google** - Looks unprofessional to natives
5. **Don't scale unprofitable ads** - ROAS <2.0 = kill immediately
6. **Don't neglect mobile** - 78% of traffic is mobile in EU
7. **Don't ignore returns policy** - EU law requires 14 days
8. **Don't pick saturated niches** - "Fitness" is too broad, "Resistance bands for seniors" is perfect

### ✅ DOs

1. **Do start with ONE country** - Master Germany before expanding
2. **Do prioritize EU suppliers** - Speed trumps price
3. **Do invest in video content** - 10x better conversion than images
4. **Do build email list Day 1** - Most profitable channel long-term
5. **Do monitor metrics daily** - Data > gut feeling
6. **Do provide exceptional support** - One angry customer = 10 lost sales
7. **Do test everything** - Never assume, always A/B test
8. **Do automate ruthlessly** - Your time is worth €50/hour, VA costs €10/hour
