### ‚è±Ô∏è MINUTE 5-10: First Repository Live

**Deploy to GitHub:**

```powershell
# Go to first repository
cd deploy\repos\superintelligence-framework

# Create on GitHub (go to github.com/new):
# - Repository name: superintelligence-framework
# - Public
# - No README (we have one)
# - Create repository

# Connect and push:
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/superintelligence-framework.git
git push -u origin main
```

**‚úÖ RESULT: First repo live on GitHub!**

### ‚è±Ô∏è MINUTE 10-15: First Website Live

**Deploy to Vercel (easiest):**

```powershell
# Go to website folder
cd ..\..\sites\ai-dashboard

# If you don't have Vercel CLI, install:
# npm install -g vercel
# (Skip if Node.js not installed - use web upload instead)

# Option A: With Vercel CLI
vercel --prod

# Option B: Without CLI (easier!)
# 1. Go to vercel.com/new
# 2. Click "Add New Project"
# 3. Import from folder (or upload as zip)

**Git push fails?**

- Check remote URL: `git remote -v`
- Use GitHub Desktop app (easier)

**Need help?**

- GitHub docs: <https://docs.github.com>
