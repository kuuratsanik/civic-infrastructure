---

## 🎯 Phase 2 Overview

Phase 2 adds **advanced autonomous capabilities** to the AI system, enabling it to:

- **Self-Upgrade**: Manage dependencies and security updates autonomously
- **Self-Develop**: Write, fix, and improve its own code with AI
- **Self-Create**: Generate new tools, scripts, integrations, and agents

2. **SelfDeveloping**:
   - ✅ Safety check before code generation
   - ✅ AI code review before execution
   - ✅ Human approval required
   - ✅ Backup before modifications
   - ✅ Test generation included

3. **SelfCreating**:
   - ✅ Impact assessment before creation
   - ✅ Safety validation for all tools
   - ✅ Specification tracking
   - ✅ Human approval for high-impact
   - ✅ Version control integration

4. **SelfImprovising**:
   - ✅ Creativity within safety boundaries
   - ✅ Validation of all novel solutions
   - ✅ Human approval for risky solutions
   - ✅ Emergency stop capability
   - ✅ Fallback to manual intervention

### Prohibited Actions (Still Enforced)

All 27 prohibited actions from Phase 1 remain enforced:

- System file modification
- Registry changes without approval
- Credential theft
- Network attacks
- Data exfiltration
- Privilege escalation
- And 21 more...
