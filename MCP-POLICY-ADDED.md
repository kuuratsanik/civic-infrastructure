- **User Control**: Limited (system-managed)

### 3. MCP Server Breakdown

Added detailed breakdown of MCP tool sources:

| MCP Server             | Tool Count     | Purpose                                                          | Recommendation                               |
| ---------------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Azure MCP**          | ~60 tools      | Azure cloud operations (ACR, AKS, Functions, SQL, Storage, etc.) | ✅ KEEP - Essential for civic infrastructure |
| **GitKraken MCP**      | ~10 tools      | Git workflow automation (branches, PRs, issues)                  | ✅ KEEP - Valuable for version control       |
| **Microsoft Docs MCP** | 3 tools        | Official documentation search and code samples                   | ✅ KEEP - Helpful for development            |
| **Core VS Code**       | ~30 tools      | File operations, terminal, workspace management                  | ✅ ESSENTIAL - Cannot disable                |
| **AI Toolkit**         | 3 tools        | AI model guidance and tracing best practices                     | ✅ USEFUL - Helpful for AI development       |
| **TOTAL**              | **~232 tools** | Combined AI agent capabilities                                   | ⚠️ Over limit but manageable                 |

### 4. New Section: MCP Server Management

Comprehensive guide covering:

#### Understanding MCP Servers

- What they are (external services providing AI capabilities)
- How they differ from VS Code extensions
- Why they're separate from extension count

#### Management Methods

- **Method 1**: VS Code settings configuration (JSON)
- **Method 2**: Disable MCP extensions if installed as extensions
- **Method 3**: Restart VS Code for fresh tool selection

#### Management Strategy

Three options clearly documented:

**Option 1: Accept Tool Count** (✅ Recommended)

- GitHub Copilot auto-selects relevant tools
- All Azure capabilities remain available
- Occasional errors are acceptable
- Best for comprehensive Azure development

**Option 2: Reduce Tool Count** (⚠️ Optional)

- Disable non-essential MCP servers
- Work in smaller scopes
- Project-based workflows
- Best if errors are frequent

**Option 3: Disable Azure MCP** (❌ Not Recommended)

- Loses all Azure AI automation
- Must use Portal/CLI manually
- Defeats purpose of cloud workspace

### 5. Enhanced Compliance Checklist

Split into two categories:

**VS Code Extensions**

- [x] Current count < 100 (Currently: 76)
- [x] Cleanup script available
- [x] Performance acceptable

**MCP Server Tools**

- [x] Understand MCP tool count
- [x] Know essential MCP servers
- [x] Accept occasional Copilot Chat failures
- [x] Inline suggestions working

### 6. Updated Success Metrics

**Current Status (17. oktoober 2025)**:

| Metric              | Extensions    | MCP Tools             |
| ------------------- | ------------- | --------------------- |
| **Current**         | 76            | ~232                  |
| **Limit**           | 100           | 128                   |
| **Status**          | ✅ COMPLIANT  | ⚠️ MANAGEABLE         |
| **Headroom/Excess** | 24 available  | 104 over              |
| **Action**          | None required | Optional optimization |

**Acceptable Trade-offs** documented:

- ✅ Accept ~232 MCP tools for Azure capabilities
- ✅ Accept occasional Copilot Chat errors
- ✅ Copilot auto-selects based on context
- ✅ All core operations available

### 7. Impact Assessment

Clear documentation of MCP tool impact:

**Extensions (76/100)**: ✅ NO ISSUES

- Fast startup, good performance, low memory

**MCP Tools (~232/128)**: ⚠️ OCCASIONAL ISSUES

- Copilot Chat may fail with "tool limit exceeded"
- Happens with comprehensive Azure tooling
- Inline suggestions work normally
- VS Code performance not affected
- Extension functionality not impacted

## Key Insights Documented

### 1. Extensions vs MCP Tools

**Critical distinction**:

- **Extensions**: User-installed VS Code add-ons (76 currently)
- **MCP Tools**: AI agent capabilities from external servers (~232 currently)
- **Confusion**: "232 tools" refers to MCP, not extensions!

### 2. GitHub Copilot Chat Limit

- Internal limit: 128 tools
- Current MCP tools: ~232
- Result: Occasional "tool limit exceeded" errors
- Solution: Copilot auto-selects relevant tools per context

### 3. Why So Many MCP Tools?

**Azure MCP alone provides 60+ tools** for:

- Container services (ACR, AKS, Container Apps)
- Compute (App Service, Functions, Virtual Machines)
- Data (CosmosDB, SQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis)
- Storage (Blob, Queue, Table, File)
- Monitoring (Application Insights, Log Analytics, Monitor)
- Security (Key Vault, Managed Identity)
- Networking (Virtual Networks, Load Balancer, Traffic Manager)
- DevOps (DevTest Labs, Load Testing, Pipelines)

Each Azure service = separate MCP tool for specificity

### 4. Recommended Approach

**For civic infrastructure project with comprehensive Azure needs**:

- ✅ Keep all current MCP servers (Azure, GitKraken, Docs)
- ✅ Accept 76 extensions (well under 100 limit)
- ✅ Accept ~232 MCP tools (need Azure capabilities)
- ✅ Accept occasional Copilot Chat errors as trade-off
- ✅ Use workarounds: rephrase queries, restart, work in scopes
