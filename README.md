# Windows 11 Pro Civic Infrastructure + AI Autonomous System

A systematic approach to treating Windows 11 Pro as reproducible, auditable civic infrastructure with ceremonial customization layers, **now enhanced with a fully autonomous AI management system**.

## 🤖 NEW: AI Autonomous System

This project now includes a **self-hosted AI management team** that autonomously controls your development environment:

- ✅ **Runs automatically on boot** - Zero manual intervention
- ✅ **100% self-hosted** - All AI runs locally (Ollama-based)
- ✅ **Intelligent decision-making** - 24/7 autonomous management
- ✅ **500-upgrade roadmap** - Enterprise-grade evolution plan
- ✅ **Privacy-first** - No cloud dependency, all local

### 🚀 Quick Start: AI System

```powershell
# Deploy autonomous AI system (one command!)
.\scripts\ai-system\Initialize-AIAutonomousSystem.ps1

# View AI dashboard
.\ai-system\Show-AIDashboard.ps1

# View live AI decisions
Get-Content ".\ai-system\logs\master\orchestrator-$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyyMMdd').log" -Tail 50 -Wait
```

## 🏛️ Project Structure

This project implements a **ceremonial customization map** where every layer can be audited, reproduced, and extended through governance-anchored workflows.

### Customization Layers

1. **Foundation**: Installation & Provisioning
2. **System Identity & Governance**: Policies and Identity Management
3. **Operational Hygiene**: Updates, Security, Key Rotation
4. **Performance & Resource Control**: Services, Power Management
5. **Developer Cockpit**: VS Code, WSL2, Containers, Package Managers
6. **UI & Ritual Layer**: Taskbar, Registry, Theming
7. **Observability & Audit**: Logging, Event Forwarding
8. **Resilience & Recovery**: Snapshots, Backups, Recovery

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Windows 11 Pro
- PowerShell 5.1+ (Windows PowerShell) or PowerShell 7+
- Administrator privileges for system-level customizations

### Basic Usage

1. **Initialize Foundation**:

   ```powershell
   .\scripts\ceremonies\01-foundation\Initialize-Foundation.ps1
   ```

2. **Setup Developer Environment**:

   ```powershell
   .\scripts\ceremonies\05-developer-cockpit\Setup-DeveloperEnvironment.ps1
   ```

3. **Run Validation Tests**:

   ```powershell
   .\tests\Invoke-ValidationTests.ps1
   ```

### Using VS Code Tasks

This project includes VS Code tasks for easy ceremony execution:

- **Ctrl+Shift+P** → "Tasks: Run Task"
- Select from available ceremonies and validation tests
- Tasks include What-If mode for safe previewing

## 🔮 Ceremony Flow

Each customization follows a standardized ceremony pattern:

1. **Bootstrap**: Install/configure → anchor hash
2. **Apply**: Execute changes → export baseline
3. **Validate**: Test configuration → log evidence
4. **Document**: Record ceremony → update audit trail

## 🛡️ Security & Governance

- All configurations are anchored with cryptographic hashes
- Changes are logged in the civic audit trail
- Scripts follow principle of least privilege
- Recovery procedures are tested and documented

## 📊 Observability

- System metrics integration with observability stack
- Audit logs centralized for governance review
- Configuration drift detection and alerting
- Performance monitoring and optimization tracking

## 🔧 Development

### Adding New Ceremonies

1. Create ceremony script in appropriate layer directory
2. Add configuration templates to `configs/templates/`
3. Document ceremony in `docs/ceremonies/`
4. Add validation tests in `tests/`
5. Update this README with usage instructions

### Testing

Run validation tests before applying ceremonies:

```powershell
.\tests\Invoke-ValidationTests.ps1
```

## 📜 License

This project follows civic infrastructure principles - configurations and scripts are provided as-is for educational and administrative purposes.

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions should maintain the ceremonial workflow patterns and governance principles outlined in the documentation.
