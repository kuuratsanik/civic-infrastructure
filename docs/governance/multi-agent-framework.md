## 🔐 Multi-Signature Lineage Chain

### **Signature Flow (Bottom-Up)**

1. **Domain Team** executes feature → signs feature result
2. **Manager** aggregates packet → signs evidence pack
3. **Assistant** collects packets → signs domain manifest
4. **Master** reviews ceremony → signs final lineage entry

## 🔄 Operational Workflow

### **Weekly Resilience Drill Example**

**Phase 1: Master Approval**
```
Master AI: "Approve weekly resilience drill with 5 packets"
  ↓ Directive: "assistant.resilience: execute 500 features"
  ↓ Resource Allocation: CPU=80%, RAM=70%, Time=15min
  ↓ Priority: HIGH
```

**Phase 2: Assistant Orchestration**
```
Assistant (Resilience): "Received directive from Master"
  ↓ Packet Selection: 5 packets × 100 features
  ↓ Manager Assignment:
      - Packet 1 → manager.hash.integrity
      - Packet 2 → manager.port.allowlist  
      - Packet 3 → manager.firewall.diff
      - Packet 4 → manager.sbom.presence
      - Packet 5 → manager.policy.compliance
  ↓ Evidence Strategy: Deduplication enabled, compression optimal
```

**Phase 3: Manager Execution**
```
Manager (Hash Integrity): "Executing packet_001 with 100 features"
  ↓ Parallel Execution: 4 threads, batch size 25
  ↓ Feature Distribution:
      - Thread 1: Features 1-25 → domain.civic.infrastructure
      - Thread 2: Features 26-50 → domain.civic.infrastructure
      - Thread 3: Features 51-75 → domain.security
      - Thread 4: Features 76-100 → domain.security
  ↓ Evidence Deduplication: 68% duplicate content detected
  ↓ Pack Hash: sha256:a1b2c3...
  ↓ Manager Signature: Applied
```

**Phase 4: Domain Execution**
```
Domain Team (Civic Infrastructure): "Executing 75 hash verification features"
  ↓ Template: Hash Verification (SHA256)
  ↓ Parameters: System configs, audit logs, ceremony records
  ↓ Results:
      - Passed: 71 features
      - Anomalies: 3 features (hash mismatch)
      - Failed: 1 feature (file not found)
  ↓ Evidence: Per-feature JSON with hashes
  ↓ Domain Signature: Applied
```

**Phase 5: Evidence Aggregation**
```
Manager → Assistant: Evidence pack with deduplication
Assistant → Master: 5 packs aggregated, 12 total anomalies
Master: Reviews anomalies, signs final manifest
  ↓ Lineage Chain: Complete and verified
  ↓ Dashboard Update: Triggered with new metrics
  ↓ Audit Trail: Entry appended with full signature chain
```
