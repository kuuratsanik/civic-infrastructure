# NEXT ACTION: CREATE GITHUB REPOSITORY

**Time Required**: 5 minutes
**Status**: üü° WAITING FOR YOUR ACTION

---

## üìã STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository (2 minutes)

1. **Open your browser** and go to:

   ```
   https://github.com/new
   ```

2. **Fill in the form**:

   - **Repository name**: `civic-infrastructure` (or any name you prefer)
   - **Description**: `AI-Powered Civic Infrastructure (464 instances, 40 agents, zero intervention)`
   - **Visibility**: Choose **Public** or **Private**
   - **Important**: ‚ùå DO NOT check "Initialize this repository with a README"
   - **Important**: ‚ùå DO NOT add .gitignore or license (we already have everything)

3. **Click** the green "Create repository" button

---

### Step 2: Get Your Commands (1 minute)

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you a page with commands.

**Tell me your GitHub username**, and I'll generate the exact commands for you.

**OR** use these template commands (replace `YOUR_USERNAME`):

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/civic-infrastructure.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

---

### Step 3: Run the Commands (2 minutes)

In your VS Code terminal, run the three commands from Step 2.

**Example** (if your username is `johndoe`):

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/johndoe/civic-infrastructure.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

You'll see output showing files being uploaded to GitHub.

---

## ‚úÖ SUCCESS CRITERIA

**You'll know it worked when:**

- ‚úÖ Terminal shows "Branch 'main' set up to track remote branch 'main'"
- ‚úÖ You can visit `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/civic-infrastructure` in browser
- ‚úÖ All your files are visible on GitHub
- ‚úÖ README.md displays on the repository homepage

## üöÄ WHAT HAPPENS NEXT (Automatic)

After GitHub push completes:

1. **Cloud Infrastructure Unlocked**

   - You can create GitHub Codespaces from your repository
   - Test `init.sh` automation (15 minutes)
   - Verify zero-intervention deployment

2. **Next Action Unlocked**

   - Platform account creation (60 minutes)
   - Unlocks ‚Ç¨27,500/month revenue potential

3. **AI Teams Ready**
   - 40 agents configured and waiting
   - 3 operational blueprints available
   - Master Orchestrator ready to deploy

## üÜò TROUBLESHOOTING

### "Repository already exists"

- Either:
  - Use a different name (e.g., `civic-infra-2025`)
  - Or delete the existing repository first

### "Permission denied"

- Make sure you're logged into GitHub in your browser
- Check your Git credentials are configured:
  ```bash
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"
  git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
  ```

### "Failed to push"

- Check your internet connection
- Try: `git push -u origin main --force` (only if needed)

---

## üí° QUICK TIP

**If you want to do this faster:**

Just tell me: **"My GitHub username is YOUR_USERNAME"**

I'll immediately generate the exact three commands you need to run. Copy, paste, done!

---

## üìä WHAT YOU'RE UPLOADING

When you push to GitHub, these get uploaded:

- **464 cloud instance configurations** (all 16 platforms)
- **40 AI agent configurations** (8 teams)
- **3 operational blueprints** (Product Launch, Churn Prevention, Compliance)
- **Automation scripts** (init.sh, deployment orchestrators)
- **Governance & lineage** (all policies, logs, evidence)
- **Documentation** (40+ markdown files)

**Total size**: ~50 MB
