## 🎯 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document maps **AI-exclusive capabilities** (tasks only AI agents can do at scale, speed, and reproducibility) into the **federation cockpit architecture**. Each capability is assigned to specific AI agents, with clear governance rituals, lineage anchoring, and multi-sig approval workflows.

**Core Principle:** AI agents don't just "help"—they execute what humans **cannot physically do** at machine scale.
