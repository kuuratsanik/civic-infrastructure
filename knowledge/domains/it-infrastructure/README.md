# IT Infrastructure Knowledge Domain

**Domain**: IT Infrastructure & Servers  
**Last Updated**: October 17, 2025

## Overview

This domain covers physical and virtual infrastructure, including servers, data centers, cloud computing, and system architecture.

## Key Topics

### 1. Server Hardware
- CPU architectures (Intel Xeon, AMD EPYC, ARM)
- Memory technologies (DDR4, DDR5, ECC)
- Storage systems (NVMe, SAS, SATA)
- Network interfaces (1GbE, 10GbE, 25GbE)
- Power and cooling considerations

### 2. Data Center Design
- Rack layouts and power distribution
- Cooling strategies
- Network topology
- Physical security
- Disaster recovery

### 3. Cloud Computing
- Public cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Private cloud
- Hybrid cloud architectures
- Multi-cloud strategies
- Cost optimization

### 4. System Architecture
- High availability design
- Scalability patterns
- Load balancing
- Failover mechanisms
- Monitoring and observability

### 5. Storage Systems
- SAN (Storage Area Network)
- NAS (Network Attached Storage)
- Object storage
- Backup and archival
- Data replication

### 6. Operating Systems
- Linux distributions (Ubuntu, RHEL, Debian)
- Windows Server
- FreeBSD
- Container-optimized OS

## Current Focus Areas

1. **Cost-Effective Procurement**: Refurbished and second-hand hardware
2. **Energy Efficiency**: Power consumption optimization
