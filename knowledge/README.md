## Knowledge Capture Process

### 1. Discovery
- Identify new technologies, techniques, or insights
- Validate source credibility and relevance
- Tag with appropriate domain(s)

### 2. Documentation
- Create blueprint for implementation (if applicable)
- Document key findings and insights
- Include references and source attribution

### 3. Implementation
- Follow blueprint to implement technology/technique
- Track progress and challenges
- Document deviations from plan

### 4. Reflection
- Create lesson learned document
- Analyze outcomes vs. expectations
- Identify improvements for future implementations

### 5. Integration
- Update relevant policies and procedures
- Share knowledge with AI autonomous system
- Archive for future reference

## Blueprint Format

```markdown
# Blueprint: [Technology/Technique Name]

**ID**: BP-YYYYMMDD-XX
**Date**: [Date]
**Source**: [Source URL/Reference]
**Technology**: [Tags]
**Status**: [Proposed/In Progress/Completed/Archived]

## Executive Summary
[Brief overview]

## Key Findings
[Main takeaways from research]

## Integration Strategy
[Phased implementation plan]

## Automation & Self-Improvement
[How this integrates with existing systems]

## Governance & Audit Trail
[Tracking and accountability]

## Acceptance Criteria
[Success metrics]
```

## Lesson Learned Format

Lessons follow this structure:

```markdown
# Lesson Learned: [Topic]

**ID**: LL-YYYYMMDD-XX
**Date**: [Date]
**Source Blueprint**: [Reference to blueprint]

## Core Insight
[Main lesson learned]

## Key Takeaways
[Numbered list of insights]

## Impact on System
[How this changes existing blueprints/policies]

## Next Actions

```

## Automation Scripts

### Knowledge Management Scripts
- `scripts/knowledge/Add-Blueprint.ps1` - Create new blueprint
- `scripts/knowledge/Add-Lesson.ps1` - Create new lesson learned
- `scripts/knowledge/Update-KnowledgeIndex.ps1` - Regenerate index
- `scripts/knowledge/Discover-NewTechnology.ps1` - Automated discovery

### Discovery Automation
The system includes automated discovery mechanisms that:
- Monitor technology news sources
- Scan academic papers and blogs
- Track GitHub trending repositories
- Identify relevant discussions and innovations

## Usage Examples

### Creating a New Blueprint
```powershell
.\scripts\knowledge\Add-Blueprint.ps1 `
    -Title "New AI Technology" `
    -Domain "ai" `
    -Source "https://example.com/article" `
    -Technology "GPT-5, Transformers"
```

### Recording a Lesson Learned
```powershell
.\scripts\knowledge\Add-Lesson.ps1 `
    -Title "GPU Cost Optimization" `
    -BlueprintId "BP-20251017-02" `
    -CoreInsight "Using spot instances reduced costs by 60%"
```

### Updating Knowledge Index
```powershell
.\scripts\knowledge\Update-KnowledgeIndex.ps1
```

## Integration with AI System

The knowledge management system integrates with the AI autonomous system:

1. **Continuous Learning**: AI agents automatically scan and process new knowledge
2. **Decision Support**: Blueprints inform autonomous decision-making
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Lessons learned improve future implementations
4. **Self-Improvement**: System evolves based on accumulated knowledge

## Governance

- All knowledge entries must include source attribution
- Blueprints require peer review before implementation
- Lessons learned are archived in blockchain ledger
- Regular audits ensure knowledge quality and relevance

## Contributing

When adding knowledge to the system:

1. Use appropriate templates
2. Follow naming conventions (BP-YYYYMMDD-XX, LL-YYYYMMDD-XX)
3. Include proper citations
4. Tag with relevant domains
5. Update this index if adding new categories
