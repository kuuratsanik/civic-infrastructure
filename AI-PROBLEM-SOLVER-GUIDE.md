# 🧠 AI Problem Solver - Complete Solution Development System

**Your AI will automatically detect, analyze, and solve ALL your problems!**

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### **Option 1: One-Time Scan**

```powershell
.\scripts\ai-system\problem-solver\AI-ProblemSolver.ps1
```

Scans once, shows problems, develops solutions, asks for approval to implement.

### **Option 2: Continuous 24/7 Mode**

```powershell
.\scripts\ai-system\problem-solver\AI-ProblemSolver.ps1 -ContinuousMode -AutoFix
```

Runs forever, automatically fixing safe problems every 15 minutes.

### **Option 3: Scan Only (No Fixes)**

```powershell
.\scripts\ai-system\problem-solver\AI-ProblemSolver.ps1 -ScanOnly
```

Just identifies problems and suggests solutions, doesn't implement.

## 🎯 What Problems Does It Solve?

### 1. **System Performance Issues** 🖥️

- ✅ High CPU usage → Identifies culprits, adjusts priorities
- ✅ High memory usage → Closes memory hogs, clears cache
- ✅ Low disk space → Cleans temp files, empties recycle bin
- ✅ Slow system → Optimizes startup, disables unnecessary services

**Example:**

```
Problem Detected: CPU at 95%
Root Cause: Chrome using 40% CPU
Solution: Close unused tabs, suggest tab suspender extension
Action: Automatically reduces Chrome priority
Result: CPU drops to 35%
```

### 2. **Software Issues** 🐛

- ✅ Application crashes → Analyzes event logs, suggests fixes
- ✅ Recurring errors → Identifies patterns, applies patches
- ✅ Compatibility issues → Detects mismatches, updates software
- ✅ Missing updates → Checks for updates, schedules installation

**Example:**

```
Problem: Application Error from "Notepad++" (12 errors in 24h)
Solution: Update to latest version, repair installation
Action: Downloads and installs update
Result: Errors eliminated
```

### 3. **Workflow Inefficiencies** ⚡

- ✅ Repetitive commands → Creates aliases/scripts
- ✅ Multiple app instances → Consolidates workspaces
- ✅ Manual tasks → Builds automation
- ✅ Slow workflows → Optimizes processes

**Example:**

```
Problem: Command 'git status' executed 47 times today
Solution: Create alias 'gs' → 'git status'
Action: Adds alias to PowerShell profile
Result: Save 10 keystrokes every time!
```

### 4. **Security Issues** 🛡️

- ✅ Antivirus disabled → Enables Windows Defender
- ✅ Firewall off → Activates all firewall profiles
- ✅ Outdated definitions → Updates virus signatures
- ✅ Weak passwords → Suggests password manager
- ✅ Unencrypted data → Enables BitLocker (with approval)

**Example:**

```
Problem: Windows Defender disabled
Severity: CRITICAL
Solution: Enable real-time protection, update definitions
Action: (Requires your approval)
Result: System protected against malware
```

### 5. **Network Issues** 🌐

- ✅ No internet → Resets adapter, flushes DNS
- ✅ Slow DNS → Switches to Google/Cloudflare DNS
- ✅ Connection drops → Diagnoses and fixes
- ✅ Port conflicts → Identifies and resolves

**Example:**

```
Problem: DNS resolution taking 2000ms
Solution: Switch to Google DNS (8.8.8.8)
Action: Updates network adapter DNS settings
Result: DNS now <50ms, web browsing 10x faster
```

### 6. **File System Issues** 📁

- ✅ Duplicate files → Identifies and removes
- ✅ Deep folder nesting → Reorganizes structure
- ✅ Orphaned files → Cleans up
- ✅ Disorganized downloads → Auto-organizes by type

**Example:**

```
Problem: 500MB of duplicate files detected
Solution: Keep newest version, delete duplicates
Action: Frees 500MB disk space
Result: Cleaner file system, more storage
```

### 7. **Development Issues** 💻

- ✅ Not a Git repo → Initializes version control
- ✅ Uncommitted changes → Creates commits
- ✅ Missing dependencies → Runs npm install / pip install
- ✅ Build failures → Analyzes logs, suggests fixes
- ✅ Port already in use → Finds and kills process

**Example:**

```
Problem: package.json exists but node_modules missing
Solution: Run 'npm install'
Action: Installs all dependencies
Result: Project runs successfully
```

### 8. **Time Management Issues** ⏰

- ✅ Too many open apps → Suggests cleanup
- ✅ Long-running processes → Identifies forgotten tasks
- ✅ Missed deadlines → Creates reminder system
- ✅ Poor focus → Suggests Pomodoro timer

## 🔍 How It Works

### **Phase 1: Detection** (Every 15 minutes in continuous mode)

```
1. Scan System Performance
   - CPU, Memory, Disk usage
   - Process analysis
   - Resource bottlenecks

2. Check Software Health
   - Event log errors
   - Application crashes
   - Update status

3. Analyze Workflows
   - Command history patterns
   - Repetitive tasks
   - Time wasters

4. Security Audit
   - Antivirus status
   - Firewall configuration
   - Update status

5. Network Check
   - Internet connectivity
   - DNS performance
   - Latency tests

6. File System Scan
   - Duplicate detection
   - Space usage
   - Organization issues

7. Development Environment
   - Git status
   - Dependencies
   - Build health
```

### **Phase 2: Analysis**

```
For each problem detected:
1. Determine root cause
2. Assess severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
3. Calculate priority (1-10)
4. Estimate fix time
5. Check if human approval needed
```

### **Phase 3: Solution Development**

```
AI creates custom solution:
1. Solution title & description
2. Step-by-step instructions
3. PowerShell automation script
4. Safety checks
5. Estimated time to fix
```

### **Phase 4: Implementation** (If AutoFix enabled)

```
1. Run safety validation
2. Ask for approval (if critical)
3. Execute automation script
4. Verify success
5. Log the fix
6. Monitor for recurrence
```
