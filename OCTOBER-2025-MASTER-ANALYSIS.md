## Article #2: How I Built a Self-Healing Home Lab (ANALYZED ✅)

### Summary

Comprehensive guide to building automated, self-healing infrastructure using monitoring, alerting, AI-driven remediation, and validation workflows.

### Core Architecture

**4 Building Blocks:**

1. **Monitoring** (Visibility Layer)

   - Tools: Netdata, Prometheus, Grafana
   - Metrics: CPU, memory, disk I/O, container uptime, service availability
   - **Netdata Cloud**: AI-driven anomaly detection

2. **Alerting** (Trigger Layer)

   - Grafana alerting engine
   - Pulse monitoring for Proxmox/Docker
   - Netdata built-in notifications
   - Channels: Email, Telegram, Pushover, webhooks

3. **Remediation + AI** (Action Layer)

   - **n8n**: Self-hosted workflow automation (event-driven)
   - **Ansible**: Infrastructure as code automation
   - **Node-RED**: Alternative workflow tool
   - **AI Agents**: ChatGPT integration for intelligent troubleshooting

4. **Validation** (Confirmation Layer)
   - Monitoring stack confirms recovery
   - Health checks post-remediation
   - Post-mortem reports generated

### n8n Workflow Automation (KEY TOOL ⭐)

**What is n8n:**

- Self-hosted workflow automation platform
- Visual canvas for building event-driven workflows
- Connects services, APIs, triggers, CLI commands
- **Similar to**: Zapier, IFTTT, but self-hosted and unlimited

**n8n Components:**

- Scheduling node (cron-like triggers)
- SSH node (remote command execution)
- Message nodes (Discord, Slack, Teams)
- HTTP Get node (API calls)
- **AI Agents** (ChatGPT, Claude, etc. integration)
- Docker/Proxmox API integration nodes

**Example Self-Healing Workflow:**

```
1. Webhook from Netdata/Prometheus (container down)
   ↓
2. Query Docker/Proxmox API (confirm failure)
   ↓
3. Execute recovery (restart container/VM)
   ↓
4. Send Pushover notification (recovery complete)
   ↓
5. Optional: Log to Google Sheet, send post-mortem
```

**Advanced Example (Author's GitLab Pipeline Healer):**

```
1. Schedule trigger (every 30 min)
   ↓
2. Get messages from Discord channel
   ↓
3. Edit fields / parse data
   ↓
4. AI Agent analyzes for errors
   ↓
5. If error found → GitLab API "get" or "post"
   ↓
6. Structured output parser cleans data
   ↓
7. If not "Normal" → Send alert to Discord
   ↓
8. Discord receives: "Found error in pipeline X, retrying..."
```

**Reference**: Network Chuck's n8n guide - [GitHub repo](https://github.com/theNetworkChuck/n8n-terry-guide)

### Physical Infrastructure Integration

**Home Assistant for Physical Devices:**

- Smart relays/outlets: Shelly, TP-Link
- Remote power cycling of hosts
- Example: If node offline >2 minutes → n8n → Home Assistant → Shelly relay → reboot

**Docker Self-Healing:**

```yaml
services:
  app:
    restart: always # Auto-restart on crash
```

**Docker Swarm/Kubernetes:**

- Continuous health monitoring
- Automatic workload rescheduling on healthy nodes

**Update Automation:**

- **Watchtower**: Auto-update Docker containers
- **Shepherd**: Docker Swarm equivalent
- Keep latest images pulled automatically

**Proxmox HA:**

- High availability clustering
- Auto-restart VMs on node failure
- Proxmox API + n8n/Ansible for programmatic management

### Safety Mechanisms

**Best Practices:**

1. **Log Everything**: Every automated action captured
2. **Cool-down Timers**: Prevent restart loops
3. **Test on Non-Critical**: Validate workflows before production
4. **Thresholds**: Reasonable limits (e.g. max 3 restarts in 10 minutes)

### Predictive Healing (AI-Driven)

**Netdata Cloud Anomaly Detection:**

- AI recognizes unusual patterns humans miss
- Examples: Traffic spikes, disk latency anomalies
- Early warnings → Proactive remediation

**n8n + Predictive Insights:**

- Trigger proactive recovery before failure
- Move workloads preemptively
- Free up resources before exhaustion

### Integration Opportunities for Civic Infrastructure
