## 🛡️ Safety Framework Details

### Prohibited Actions (Hard-Coded Blocks)

The AI **CANNOT** perform:

- ❌ Delete system files or Windows directories
- ❌ Expose secrets, passwords, or API keys in logs
- ❌ Disable security features (Windows Defender, Firewall)
- ❌ Modify critical system services
- ❌ Execute unsigned or unverified code
- ❌ Send user data externally without consent

### Risk Levels

All actions are classified:

| Level | Description | Requirements |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| **SAFE** | Read-only | Execute freely |
| **LOW** | Minor config | Log and execute |
| **MEDIUM** | System changes | Backup + execute |
| **HIGH** | Data modification | Backup + approval |
| **CRITICAL** | Data deletion | Backup + multi-approval |

### Safety Workflow

```
Proposed Action
    ↓
┌─────────────────────┐
│ Safety Framework    │
│ 1. Prohibited?      │ ── Yes ─→ BLOCK
│ 2. Risk assessment  │
│ 3. Backup exists?   │ ── No ──→ BLOCK
│ 4. User approval?   │ ── No ──→ BLOCK
│ 5. Execute safely   │
└─────────────────────┘
    ↓
  Execute
    ↓
┌─────────────────────┐
│ Verify success      │
│ If fail → Rollback  │
└─────────────────────┘
```

## 🧠 Self-Learning System

### How It Works

1. **Record Experiences**: Every action is logged with outcome
2. **Extract Lessons**: Analyze successes and failures
3. **Detect Patterns**: Find recurring successful strategies
4. **Build Knowledge**: Create best practice database
5. **Apply Learning**: Use past knowledge for future decisions

### Example Usage

```powershell
# Record an experience
Add-Experience `
    -Context "System optimization" `
    -Action "Clear-TempFiles" `
    -Outcome "Freed 2GB disk space" `
    -Result "Success" `
    -ConfidenceScore 0.9

# Get best action based on learning
$Best = Get-BestAction -Context "System optimization"

# AI will now prefer "Clear-TempFiles" for optimization tasks
```

### Knowledge Base Structure

```
ai-system/data/learning/
  ├── learning.db.json       # Main knowledge base
  ├── patterns.db.json       # Detected patterns
  ├── successes.db.json      # Successful strategies
  ├── failures.db.json       # Failed attempts
  └── experiences/
      ├── {guid}.json        # Individual experiences
      └── ...
```

## 🔬 Self-Researching System

### Trusted Sources

The AI only researches from:

- ✅ docs.microsoft.com, learn.microsoft.com
- ✅ github.com, stackoverflow.com
- ✅ docs.python.org, nodejs.org/docs
- ✅ Official package registries (NuGet, npm, PyPI)
- ✅ Security advisories (NVD, CVE, GitHub Advisories)

### Research Workflow

```powershell
# Find solution to a problem
$Solutions = Find-Solution `
    -Problem "High CPU usage" `
    -Context "Windows system" `
    -Constraints @("must be safe", "no third-party tools")

# Returns ranked solutions from:
# 1. Documentation
# 2. Local knowledge base
# 3. Similar past problems
```

### Fact Verification

```powershell
# Verify a claim against multiple sources
$Verification = Invoke-FactVerification `
    -Claim "PowerShell 7 has better performance than 5.1" `
    -MinSources 2

if ($Verification.Verified) {
    Write-Host "Claim verified with $($Verification.SourceCount) trusted sources"
}
```

---

## 🔧 Self-Improving System

### Code Optimization

```powershell
# Optimize a script file
$Result = Optimize-Code `
    -FilePath "scripts\my-script.ps1" `
    -OptimizationTargets @('Performance', 'Memory', 'Readability')

# AI will:
# 1. Create backup
# 2. Analyze code metrics
# 3. Apply optimizations
# 4. Verify improvements
# 5. Rollback if worse
```

### Quality Metrics

- **Complexity**: Decision points (if, switch, loops)
- **Duplication**: Repeated code patterns
- **Maintainability**: Comments, naming, structure

---

## 🎭 Master Orchestrator (Safety-Enhanced)

### Autonomous Decision-Making

The Master Orchestrator makes decisions every 30 seconds:

1. **Analyze System**: Check CPU, memory, disk, processes
2. **Research Solutions**: Use self-researching to find fixes
3. **Check Learned Knowledge**: Apply past successful actions
4. **Safety Validation**: MANDATORY safety check
5. **Execute or Block**: Only safe actions execute
6. **Record Experience**: Learn from outcome

### Example Decision Flow

```
System: CPU usage high (85%)
    ↓
Research: Find solutions for "high CPU usage"
    ↓
Learning: Check past successful actions
    ↓
Propose: "Get-Process | Sort-Object CPU -Descending | Select-Object -First 5"
    ↓
Safety Check: Risk=LOW, Scope=Read, Destructive=No
    ↓
APPROVED: Execute action
    ↓
Record: Success → Add to knowledge base
```
