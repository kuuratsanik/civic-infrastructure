# SEPTEMBER 2025 — Consolidated Report

**Analysis Date:** 2025-10-17
**Scope:** Consolidated findings and recommendations from 10 articles on VirtualizationHowto (September 2025)

## Executive Summary

Refer to `september-2025/executive-summary.md` for the short-form overview. This report expands on actionable items, priorities, risks, and acceptance criteria for implementing recommendations.

## Top Priorities (0-6 weeks)

1. Reverse Proxy Modernization (Pangolin / NPMplus) — deploy, test failover, and integrate audit logging.
2. Core Service Foundation — DNS, DHCP, and monitoring (Netdata) deployment.
3. Hardware & Storage Upgrades — procure mini PCs and a TerraMaster NAS; configure UPS and backup workflows.
4. GPU Testbeds — enable GPU passthrough via PECU and deploy local inference stacks (Ollama/LocalAI).
5. Security Hardening — deploy OPNsense and integrate CrowdSec where applicable.

## Action Plan (Detailed)

- Week 0-2: Deploy Pangolin in Docker/WSL2, configure domain routes, test automatic SSL and daily health checks via n8n.
- Week 2-4: Procurement and NAS setup; configure evidence backup to NAS and Azure blob (weekly).
- Week 4-6: GPU testbed and AI stack deployment; PECU-driven Proxmox configuration; local model inference verification.

## Per-Article Highlights & Actions

- MINIX Elite EU715-AI: Purchase as Tier-2 node; run NVMe and thermal tests.
- Pangolin Reverse Proxy: Migrate from NPM to Pangolin; create migration scripts and blockchain audit entries.
- Nginx Proxy Manager vs NPMplus: Evaluate NPMplus in staging for CrowdSec features.
- Best Docker Containers: Add Ollama, Netdata, Dozzle templates; create n8n update-check workflows.
- OPNsense: Test in staging VLAN; prepare reporting integration; configure Zenarmor plugin if needed.
- Windows 11 25H2: Bake test images and run validation ceremonies before upgrades.
- NVMe Performance: Add procurement checks and scheduled fio tests.
- First Services: Ensure DNS/Proxy/Monitoring are in foundation ceremonies.
- Proxmox PECU: Use PECU for GPU passthrough in test environment prior to production rollout.

## Risks & Mitigations

- Auto-update breakage: Gate Watchtower/auto-updates behind staging and use rollback containers.
- NVMe thermal throttling: Add scheduled IO tests with Netdata dashboards and alerts.
- OPNsense HA complexity: Keep single-node staging and document HA requirements before production.

## Cost Estimate (High Level)

- Tier 2 Hardware + NAS: $1,500 - $2,000
- Pangolin Pro (optional): $9/month
- Azure Blob storage for backups: $1-$5/month

## Acceptance Criteria

- Reverse proxy supports automatic SSL and failover
- Evidence storage is backed up weekly to Azure Blob
- Monitoring sends critical alerts to Discord and records incidents to blockchain
- GPU testbed can run basic model inference locally
- Blockchain record #11 appended with report hash

## Next Steps

- Execute `ceremonies/03-network/Install-Pangolin.ps1` in staging
- Create n8n workflow for Pangolin health monitoring and alerts
- Schedule procurement and NVMe tests via n8n
- Prepare `SEPTEMBER-REPORT.md` for signing and append to blockchain
