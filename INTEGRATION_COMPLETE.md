**Step 3:** Run Setup Wizard
```powershell
.\scripts\Setup-ISOBuildSystem.ps1
```

### Option 3: Use VS Code Tasks

**After installing prerequisites manually:**

1. **Verify Prerequisites:**
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`
   - Type: `Tasks: Run Task`
   - Select: `Check ISO Build Prerequisites`

2. **Extract ISO (if needed):**
   - Run task: `Extract Windows 11 ISO`

3. **Build Your First ISO:**

## 💡 TIPS & BEST PRACTICES

### First-Time Setup
1. Install Windows ADK first (smaller, faster)
2. Start Windows 11 ISO download while ADK installs
3. Run setup wizard after both are ready
4. Let wizard handle extraction and first build

### Regular Usage
1. Use VS Code task: "Build Custom ISO"
2. Or run ceremony script directly
3. Monitor progress with "Monitor ISO Build Results" task
4. Find output in `workspace/output/`

### Customization
1. Add more `.reg` files to `workspace/customization/tweaks/`
2. Modify `templates/debloat/Remove-Bloatware.ps1` to remove more apps
3. Create warrants for specific build configurations
4. Use different output names for versioning

### Troubleshooting
1. Run "Check ISO Build Prerequisites" task to diagnose issues
2. Check logs at `logs/agents/iso-build.jsonl`
3. Verify warrants in `council/warrants/active/`
4. Review council ledger at `logs/council_ledger.jsonl`
