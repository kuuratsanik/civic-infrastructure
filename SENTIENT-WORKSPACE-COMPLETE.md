# [1] Learning Mode (30 days)
# [2] Suggestion Mode (14 days)
# [3] Autonomous Mode (full control)
```

### **Option 2: Direct Launch**

```powershell
# Learning Mode (observe and learn)
.\agents\master\sentient-orchestrator.ps1 -OperatingMode Learning -WatchMode

# Suggestion Mode (propose automations)
.\agents\master\sentient-orchestrator.ps1 -OperatingMode Suggestion -WatchMode

# Autonomous Mode (full AI control)
.\agents\master\sentient-orchestrator.ps1 -OperatingMode Autonomous -WatchMode
```

```

### **Week 2-4: Pattern Detection**

- AI agents collect 10,080 observations (1 per minute)
- Detect 20+ behavioral patterns
- Build comprehensive user profile

### **Month 2: Suggestion Phase**

```powershell
# Switch to suggestion mode
.\Start-SentientWorkspace.ps1
# Choose [2] Suggestion Mode

# Review and approve automation suggestions
# Provide feedback to refine agent behavior
```

### **Month 3-6: Full Autonomy**

```powershell
# Switch to autonomous mode
.\Start-SentientWorkspace.ps1
# Choose [3] Autonomous Mode

# System operates independently
# Zero manual intervention required
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### **Maximizing Learning Quality**

- Use your PC normally during learning phase
- Don't change your habits to "help" the AI
- The more diverse your usage, the better the learning
- Let it run for full 30 days for best results

### **Providing Good Feedback**

- Be specific when rejecting suggestions
- Customize automations to your exact needs
- Don't approve everything - be selective
- Quality feedback leads to better automations

### **Monitoring System Health**

```powershell
# View statistics
.\Start-SentientWorkspace.ps1
# Choose [4] View Statistics

# Check observation logs
Get-Content C:\ai-council\logs\observations.jsonl -Tail 100

# Review detected patterns
Get-Content C:\ai-council\profiles\detected-patterns.json | ConvertFrom-Json
```
