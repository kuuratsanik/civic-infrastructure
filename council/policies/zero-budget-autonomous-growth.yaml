status: "ACTIVE"
authority: "User Mandate + AI Council"

# ============================================================================
# CORE PRINCIPLE: Start with $0, grow autonomously, reinvest profits
# ============================================================================

manifesto: |
  This policy establishes a zero-budget autonomous growth framework where:
  1. Start with absolutely ZERO financial investment
  2. Leverage only FREE resources (cloud trials, open source, knowledge)
  3. Learn, update, upgrade, and improve AUTOMATICALLY
  4. Generate profit through automation and intelligence
  5. Reinvest profits into online resources FIRST
  6. When profits are substantial, procure physical hardware
  7. Expand everywhere autonomously without human intervention
