→ Generate evidence bundle
→ Track lineage
→ Verify integrity
→ Human intervention: ZERO
→ Time: 5 minutes setup, 25 minutes automated build
```

### Example 2: Foundation Ceremony with Governance

```powershell
# Execute foundation ceremony
.\scripts\ceremonies\01-foundation\Initialize-Foundation.ps1

# AI Teams automatically:
→ Check current system state
→ Generate multi-sig approval request
→ Execute with resource optimization
→ Create evidence bundle
→ Update lineage graph
→ Log to audit trail
→ Verify completion
```

### Example 3: Complete Development Environment Setup

```powershell
# Run developer cockpit ceremony
.\scripts\ceremonies\05-developer-cockpit\Setup-DeveloperEnvironment.ps1

# AI Teams automatically:
→ Detect missing tools (PowerShell 7, WSL2, etc.)
→ Install prerequisites
→ Configure environments
