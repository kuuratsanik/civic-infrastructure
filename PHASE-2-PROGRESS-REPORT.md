## Deploy-FullPower-Governed.ps1 Analysis

**Purpose:** Governance-enhanced deployment wrapper that adds blockchain logging, evidence bundles, and approval checkpoints to the original Deploy-FullPower.ps1 script.

**Lines:** 248 (originally 259, edited during fixes)
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Created, syntax fixes applied, execution mode issue discovered

### Features Implemented

**1. Blockchain Logging** ‚úÖ

- Logs deployment start to blockchain ledger
- Logs approval/cancellation (if -RequireApproval used)
- Logs deployment result (success/failure) with metadata
- All logs include deployment ID, timestamp, mode, evidence path

**2. Evidence Bundles** ‚úÖ

```
evidence/deployments/wave9-{timestamp}/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ manifest.json (deployment metadata)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ deployment-transcript.log (full transcript)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ deployment-error.txt (if failed)
```

**3. Approval Checkpoints** ‚úÖ

- Optional `-RequireApproval` flag for governance workflows
- Displays deployment details and proposed changes
- Logs approval/cancellation to blockchain ledger
- User input via `Read-Host "Approve deployment [yes/no]"`

**4. Integrity Verification** ‚úÖ

- Verifies blockchain ledger integrity after deployment
- Detects tampering or chain breaks
- Reports verification status in governance summary

### Fixes Applied

**Fix #1:** Read-Host Syntax Error ‚úÖ

```powershell
# Before:
Read-Host "Approve deployment? (yes/no)"
# Error: PowerShell interprets (yes/no) as command

# After:
Read-Host "Approve deployment [yes/no]"
```

**Fix #2:** String Interpolation Error ‚úÖ

```powershell
# Before:
Write-Host "üöÄ Executing deployment (Mode: $Mode)..." -ForegroundColor Cyan
# Error: PowerShell interprets colon as drive separator

# After:
Write-Host "üöÄ Executing deployment (Mode = $Mode)..." -ForegroundColor Cyan
```

### Current Issue: Script Execution Mode

**Problem:** Script runs in verbose/debug mode, showing each line of code instead of executing:

```powershell
 = Add-CouncilLedgerEntry
  -Action Wave 9 Deployment Started
  -Actor svenk
  -Metadata @{...}
```

**Expected:** Script should execute silently with only `Write-Host` output visible

**Possible Causes:**

1. `-Verbose` flag set in environment
2. `$VerbosePreference = "Continue"` in profile
3. PowerShell debug mode enabled
4. Script parsing error causing fallback to verbose mode

**Investigation Needed:**

- Check `$VerbosePreference`, `$DebugPreference`, `$WhatIfPreference`
- Test script with explicit `-Verbose:$false`
- Review PowerShell profile for global settings
- Test with clean PowerShell session

---

## Next Immediate Steps (Priority Order)

### Step 1: Investigate Script Execution Mode (30 min)

**Objective:** Determine why Deploy-FullPower-Governed.ps1 runs in verbose/debug mode

**Actions:**

1. Check PowerShell environment preferences:

   ```powershell
   $VerbosePreference
   $DebugPreference
   $WhatIfPreference
   $ErrorActionPreference
   ```

2. Test script with explicit preference override:

   ```powershell
   $VerbosePreference = "SilentlyContinue"
   .\Deploy-FullPower-Governed.ps1 -Mode LocalOnly
   ```

3. Review PowerShell profile for global settings:

   ```powershell
   notepad $PROFILE
   ```

4. Test in clean PowerShell session:
   ```powershell
   powershell.exe -NoProfile -File "Deploy-FullPower-Governed.ps1" -Mode LocalOnly
   ```

### Step 2: Complete Local Deployment Testing (1 hour)

**Objective:** Successfully execute local-only deployment with governance wrapper

**Success Criteria:**

- ‚úÖ Script executes without verbose output
- ‚úÖ Blockchain ledger entry added (deployment start)
- ‚úÖ Evidence bundle created with manifest
- ‚úÖ Deployment completes (or fails gracefully)
- ‚úÖ Final ledger entry added (deployment result)
- ‚úÖ Ledger integrity verified

### Step 3: Full Azure Deployment (2-3 hours)

**Objective:** Deploy Wave 9 Sentient Workspace to Azure with governance logging

**Prerequisites:**

- Azure subscription ID
- Resource group name (default: sentient-workspace-rg)
- Azure CLI authenticated
- Local deployment test successful

**Command:**

```powershell
.\Deploy-FullPower-Governed.ps1 `
  -Mode Full `
  -RequireApproval `
  -AzureSubscriptionId <GUID> `
  -ResourceGroup sentient-workspace-rg
```

**Expected Ledger Entries:**

1. Wave 9 Deployment Started
2. Wave 9 Deployment Approved (if -RequireApproval)
3. Wave 9 Deployment Complete (success/failure)

### Step 4: Implement Timelock Mechanism (1-2 hours)

**Objective:** Create governance timelock for ceremonial workflows

**Script:** `scripts/ceremonies/common/Invoke-Timelock.ps1`

**Features:**

- Create proposal with timelock delay
- Log proposal to blockchain ledger
- Wait for timelock expiration (1h test, 24h production)
- Execute ceremony after delay
- Log execution result to ledger

**Integration:** Apply to foundation ceremony:

```powershell
Invoke-Timelock -Hours 1 -CeremonyName "Foundation" -ProposedChanges @{...}
```

## Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks

**Risk #1: Script Execution Mode Issue**

- **Impact:** Blocks all deployment testing
- **Probability:** Medium (environmental issue, fixable)
- **Mitigation:** Investigate preferences, test with clean session
- **Timeline:** 30 minutes to resolve

**Risk #2: Azure Deployment Failures**

- **Impact:** Phase 2 incomplete, Wave 9 not operational
- **Probability:** Medium (complex multi-service deployment)
- **Mitigation:** Test locally first, deploy incrementally
- **Timeline:** 2-3 hours with proper testing

### Medium Priority Risks

**Risk #3: Timelock Mechanism Complexity**

- **Impact:** Governance workflows delayed
- **Probability:** Low (well-understood pattern from DevMode2026)
- **Mitigation:** Use DevMode2026 patterns, test with 1h delay first
- **Timeline:** 1-2 hours implementation

**Risk #4: Evidence Bundle Storage Growth**

- **Impact:** Disk space consumption over time
- **Probability:** Low (each bundle ~1-5MB)
- **Mitigation:** Implement retention policy (e.g., keep last 30 days)
- **Timeline:** Future enhancement (Phase 4)

### Low Priority Risks

**Risk #5: Blockchain Ledger Verification Performance**

- **Impact:** Slower ledger operations at scale
- **Probability:** Low (current 6 records, minimal impact)
- **Mitigation:** Optimize verification script, use incremental verification
- **Timeline:** Phase 3 enhancement

---

- Deployment Testing: 30% ‚è≥
- Azure Deployment: 0% ‚è≥
- Timelock Mechanism: 0% ‚è≥

**Estimated Time to Completion:** 4-6 hours (assuming no major blockers)

---

## Lessons Learned

### Technical Insights

**1. PowerShell Array Behavior**

- `Get-Content | ConvertFrom-Json` returns single object for 1-line file, array for multi-line
- Always wrap with `@()` to force array type: `@(Get-Content ...)`
- Affects JSONL parsing and chain linking logic

**2. PowerShell String Interpolation**

- Colon after variable causes issues: `"Text: $var"` interprets colon as drive separator
- Use `-f` format operator or change punctuation: `"Text = $var"`
- Affects `Write-Host` statements with metadata display

**3. Read-Host Syntax**

- Parentheses in prompt string interpreted as command: `(yes/no)` tries to execute `yes/no` command
- Use brackets instead: `[yes/no]`
- Affects approval checkpoint prompts

**4. Blockchain Chain Linking**

- Previous_hash must link to previous record's record_hash
- Genesis block uses all-zero previous_hash: `0000...0000`
- Fix applied to new records only; legacy Record #1 has wrong previous_hash (documented)

### Process Insights

**1. Governance-First Approach**

- Implementing governance system before main deployment creates auditable foundation
- All actions (including failures) are logged and evidence-captured
- Betrayal-resistant audit trail established early

**2. Incremental Testing**

- Test blockchain ledger separately before integration
- Verify chain linking fix with test entries before deployment
- Catch errors early in isolated environments

**3. Evidence-Based Debugging**

- Evidence bundles capture deployment failures automatically
- Blockchain ledger provides timeline of all actions
- Transcript logs show exact command execution

**4. Documentation Continuity**

- Comprehensive documentation enables seamless continuation
- Status reports provide full context after breaks
- Technical details preserved for future reference
