### Month 2-3 (Core Infrastructure)

### Month 4-6 (Advanced & Automation)

## 🚀 System Integration & Autonomous Policy Activation

### Zero-Budget Autonomous Growth Policy

- Integrated council/policies/zero-budget-autonomous-growth.yaml as the operational baseline.
- System now defaults to free/open-source resources and services until profit is generated.
- All profit is automatically reinvested into online resources, infrastructure, and AI tools.
- When profit exceeds strategic thresholds, the system will generate a procurement list and vendor recommendations for hardware/software upgrades.

### AI Resource Automation

- Top English-language AI research, tooling, and news sites are now referenced for self-learning and self-update routines.
- Automated scripts and workflows will periodically scan, fetch, and integrate new best practices, open-source models, and frameworks from:
  - OpenAI, DeepMind, Hugging Face, Google AI, Microsoft AI, IBM Watson, NVIDIA AI, Stability AI, Allen AI, and more.
- System blueprints and documentation will be updated as new technologies and methods are validated.

### Self-Improvement & Governance Anchoring

- All sync, deployment, and governance events are now logged in the blockchain ledger (logs/council_ledger.jsonl) for full auditability.
- The GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/sync-and-log.yml) ensures the local system is always reconciled with the most advanced remote lineage.
- PowerShell automation scripts (scripts/ci/rebase-and-log.ps1) handle safe rebase/merge, conflict resolution, and governance anchoring.
- Self-learning and self-upgrade logic is embedded in the automation stack, with regular blueprint and documentation refreshes.

### Next Steps

- Monitor profit and trigger reinvestment logic as soon as thresholds are met.
- Continue to expand automation, AI integration, and governance anchoring as new resources and requirements emerge.
- Review and refine blueprints quarterly to ensure the system remains state-of-the-art and self-sustaining.
