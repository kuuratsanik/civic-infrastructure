## üéØ How To Use

### Quick Test (5 minutes)

```powershell
# 1. Test Safety Framework
Import-Module ".\scripts\ai-system\safety\SafetyFramework.ps1"

# Test prohibited action (should be blocked)
Test-ProhibitedAction -Action "Remove-Item C:\Windows\System32"
# Returns: True (blocked!)

# Test safe action (should be allowed)
$SafetyCheck = Invoke-SafetyCheck -Action "Get-Process" -Context @{Scope="Read"}
# Returns: Approved=True, RiskLevel=SAFE

# 2. Test Self-Learning
Import-Module ".\scripts\ai-system\self-capabilities\SelfLearning.ps1"
Initialize-LearningSystem

# Record an experience
Add-Experience `
    -Context "System optimization" `
    -Action "Clear temp files" `
    -Outcome "Freed 2GB" `
    -Result "Success"

# Get best action
Get-BestAction -Context "System optimization"

# 3. Test Self-Researching
Import-Module ".\scripts\ai-system\self-capabilities\SelfResearching.ps1"

# Search for solutions
Find-Solution -Problem "High CPU usage" -Context "Windows system"

# Research best practices
Get-BestPractice -Technology "PowerShell" -Aspect "Performance"

# 4. Run Safe AI Orchestrator
.\agents\master\master-orchestrator-safe.ps1
```

### Full Deployment

```powershell
# Option 1: Add to existing AI system initialization
# Edit: scripts/ai-system/Initialize-AIAutonomousSystem.ps1
# Add safety framework deployment

# Option 2: Run safe orchestrator directly
.\agents\master\master-orchestrator-safe.ps1

# Option 3: Update task scheduler
$Action = New-ScheduledTaskAction `
    -Execute "powershell.exe" `
    -Argument "-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\path\to\agents\master\master-orchestrator-safe.ps1"

Register-ScheduledTask `
    -TaskName "AI-MasterOrchestrator-Safe" `
    -Action $Action `
    -Trigger (New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -AtStartup) `
    -User "SYSTEM" `
    -RunLevel Highest
```

## üìä What Happens Now

### Every 30 Seconds, the AI

1. **Analyzes System State**
   - CPU, memory, disk, processes

2. **Identifies Needs**
   - High CPU? Low memory? Disk full?

3. **Researches Solutions**
   - Searches documentation
   - Checks local knowledge
   - Finds similar past problems

4. **Checks Learned Knowledge**
   - What worked before?
   - What failed before?

5. **Proposes Action**
   - Best action based on research + learning

6. **üõ°Ô∏è MANDATORY SAFETY CHECK** ‚Üê **THIS IS THE KEY**
   - Is it prohibited? ‚Üí BLOCK
   - What's the risk level?
   - Does backup exist? ‚Üí If not, BLOCK
   - Needs approval? ‚Üí Ask user

7. **Executes (Only if Safe)**
   - Run the action
   - Verify success
   - Rollback if failed

8. **Records Experience**
   - Add to knowledge base
   - Update success rates
   - Improve for next time

## üîê Safety Examples

### Example 1: Safe Action

```
User: The AI detects high CPU usage

AI Research: Searches "high CPU usage solutions"
AI Learning: Checks past successful actions
AI Proposes: "Get-Process | Sort-Object CPU -Descending | Select-Object -First 5"

Safety Check:
  ‚úÖ Not prohibited (read-only)
  ‚úÖ Risk Level: SAFE
  ‚úÖ No backup needed (read-only)
  ‚úÖ No approval needed (low risk)

Result: APPROVED ‚úÖ
Action: Executed successfully
Learning: Recorded as success ‚Üí Will use again
```

### Example 2: Blocked Action

```
User: The AI tries to free disk space

AI Research: Searches "free disk space Windows"
AI Learning: No past knowledge
AI Proposes: "Remove-Item C:\Windows\Temp\* -Recurse -Force"

Safety Check:
  ‚ùå PROHIBITED: Matches pattern 'Remove-Item.*-Recurse.*C:\Windows'
  ‚ùå Risk Level: CRITICAL

Result: BLOCKED üõë
Reason: Matches prohibited action pattern
Learning: Recorded as failure ‚Üí Won't try again
Alternative: Suggest user manually review C:\Temp
```

### Example 3: Requires Approval

```
User: The AI wants to optimize a script

AI Research: Searches "PowerShell code optimization"
AI Learning: Past optimizations were 70% successful
AI Proposes: "Optimize-Code -FilePath C:\scripts\important.ps1"

Safety Check:
  ‚úÖ Not prohibited
  ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Level: HIGH (modifies code)
  ‚úÖ Backup exists: important.ps1.backup
  ‚ö†Ô∏è Approval required: YES

User Prompt:
  "Risk Level: HIGH
   Proposed Action: Optimize-Code -FilePath C:\scripts\important.ps1
   Mitigation: Backup exists at important.ps1.backup
   Approve? (Yes/No): _"

If Yes ‚Üí Execute + Record success
If No  ‚Üí Block + Record user decline
```
