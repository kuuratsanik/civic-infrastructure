# September 2025 â€” Executive Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-17
**Scope**: Analysis of 10 articles from VirtualizationHowto (September 2025)

## Highlights

- Completed analysis of 10 articles covering home lab hardware, reverse proxies, containers, networking, Windows 25H2, NVMe performance, Proxmox GPU tooling, and core services.
- Key recommendations: adopt Pangolin (or NPMplus) for reverse proxy, prioritize Tier-2 hardware purchases (Geekom/MINIX + TerraMaster NAS), and enable GPU testbeds with PECU.
- Operational next steps: deploy reverse proxy, add monitoring, secure networking with OPNsense, and automate backups of evidence to Azure.

## Benefits to Civic Infrastructure

- Improved reliability and auditability via cloud-coordinated reverse proxy and blockchain logging
- Lower operating cost and power consumption by adopting mini PC nodes
- Faster AI experimentation by enabling GPU passthrough and local inference stacks
- Stronger observability and incident response using Netdata + n8n workflows

## High-Level Timeline

- 0-2 weeks: Reverse proxy, DNS/DHCP, monitoring
- 2-4 weeks: Hardware procurement, NAS setup, UPS integration
- 4-6 weeks: GPU testbed, AI stacks, security hardening

## Required Manual Inputs

- Azure Blob Storage credentials for backups
- Discord webhook for alerts and notifications
