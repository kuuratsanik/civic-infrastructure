## Executive Summary

This article lists practical containers for Docker Desktop in 2025: Ollama, MCP servers, Dozzle, Netdata, Watchtower, Code-server, Whoogle, SearxNG, JupyterLab, and LocalAI. These are solid options for local developer tooling and for integration into civic infrastructure test environments.

## Key Takeaways

- Ollama and MCP servers are recommended for local AI and MCP interoperability.
- Netdata and Dozzle provide lightweight observability for containerised workloads.
- Watchtower is useful for automated image updates (use with caution in production).

## Implementation Notes

- Add recommended container templates to `docker/templates/docker-desktop-helpers.yml`.
- Use n8n tasks to periodically check image updates and schedule maintenance windows.

## Risks & Mitigations

- Auto-updates can break production; gate updates behind staging and quick rollback scripts.
- Containers that expose services publicly should be behind the reverse proxy (Pangolin/NPMplus).
