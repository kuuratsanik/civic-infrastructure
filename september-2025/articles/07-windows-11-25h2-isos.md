## Executive Summary

Microsoft's Windows 11 25H2 is rolling out via enablement packages and ISOs. Enablement packages make upgrades faster and reduce downtime for users already on 24H2. For civic infrastructure, this indicates administrators can start planning validation testing and deployment strategies.

## Key Takeaways

- Enablement packages reduce download/installation time for upgrades from 24H2.
- Validate existing automation scripts and drivers before broad rollouts.
- Create test images and perform VM snapshots prior to upgrades.

## Implementation Notes

- Add a validation ceremony to test Win11 25H2 in a staging VM and bake golden images.
- Document upgrade steps in `ceremonies/07-windows/Upgrade-Windows-25H2.ps1` and record results in `evidence/`.
