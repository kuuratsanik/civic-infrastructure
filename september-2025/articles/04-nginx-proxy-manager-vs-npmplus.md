## Executive Summary

NPMplus is a community-enhanced fork of Nginx Proxy Manager that adds modern features for home labs (HTTP/3, CrowdSec integration, geo-blocking, performance improvements). For most users the migration path is straightforward; those needing advanced security and performance should consider NPMplus.

## Key Findings

- NPMplus enables new features (HTTP/3/QUIC, CrowdSec) that reduce operational overhead for exposed services.
- Migration is feasible via data export/import; NPMplus uses sqlite by default.
- For simple setups Nginx Proxy Manager remains a fine choice; for scaling and hardening, NPMplus is preferable.

## Civic Infrastructure Impact

- If governance requires intrusion detection (CrowdSec) and geo-blocking, prefer NPMplus.
- Document migration steps in `ceremonies/03-network/` and add blockchain audit entries for route changes.

## Suggested Actions

- Test NPMplus in staging container on a dedicated dev VLAN before production cutover.
- Use n8n to automate route audits and certificate renewals logging.
