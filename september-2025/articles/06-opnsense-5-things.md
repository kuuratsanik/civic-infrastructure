## Executive Summary

OPNsense is a capable open-source firewall suitable for home labs, but it requires planning: web filtering isn't included by default, reporting is limited, and many features require additional plugins. High-availability WAN setups need extra public IPs.

## Key Takeaways

- Plan for plugin-based features (Zenarmor for web filtering).
- Reporting and monitoring may need external tools (Netdata, Prometheus/Grafana).
- High-availability setups increase complexity and cost.

## Implementation Notes for Civic Infrastructure

- Use OPNsense in a test VLAN before deploying to production VLANs.
- Store configuration templates in `configs/network/opnsense/` and version-control them.
- Use n8n to collect OPNsense logs and forward critical events to Discord and the evidence store.
