## Executive Summary

The MINIX Elite EU715-AI is a compact mini PC targeting AI workloads and home labs. It packs modern CPU cores, multiple NVMe slots, and improved thermal headroom. The review highlights its suitability as a low-power, quiet node for Proxmox/VM workloads and for small-scale local AI experiments.

## Key Takeaways

- Strong balance of performance and power efficiency.
- Multiple NVMe slots enable flexible storage tiers (boot + fast VM storage).
- Good compatibility with Proxmox, Docker Desktop, and Windows 11 in WSL2 scenarios.
- Recommended for users building multi-node energy-efficient clusters.

## Implementation Notes for Civic Infrastructure

- Consider as a Tier-2 compute node for the civic infrastructure (mini PC role).
- Ensure NVMe lane and thermal profile checks during procurement.
- Use for Proxmox host or dedicated container host depending on needs.

## Risks & Mitigations

- NVMe thermal throttling => add dashboard monitoring and scheduled IO testing (Netdata).
- BIOS/firmware quirks => pin known-good firmware and document in `configs/firmware/`.

## Suggested n8n & Ceremony Actions

- Add procurement record to `evidence/` and log to blockchain when purchased.
- Add a scheduled n8n job to run NVMe throughput tests weekly and log results.
