## Executive Summary

Many mini PCs underperform NVMe-specified speeds due to shared PCIe lanes, firmware choices, and thermal constraints. Buyers should check lane allocation, motherboard M.2 lane sharing, and thermal throttling behavior before purchase.

## Key Takeaways

- Check PCIe lane allocations and whether NVMe shares lanes with USB or other devices.
- Thermal throttling is a common cause of reduced sustained throughput.
- Use scheduled IO benchmarks to monitor ongoing performance.

## Implementation Notes

- Add hardware procurement checks to `configs/procurement/checklist.md` capturing PCIe lane layout and cooling specs.
- Use n8n scheduled jobs to run fio tests on NVMe and log results to `evidence/`.
