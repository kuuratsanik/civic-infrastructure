## Executive Summary

Core services to deploy early: DNS, DHCP, reverse proxy, monitoring, and basic backup workflows. These provide a foundation for reliable service discovery, secure access, and observability.

## Key Takeaways

- DNS and reverse proxy should be among the first services for consistent access and SSL management.
- Monitoring (Netdata/Prometheus) helps detect issues early and protect evidence integrity.
- Backup workflows for evidence should be in place before major configuration changes.

## Implementation Notes

- Add these services to `ceremonies/01-foundation` (DNS, DHCP) and `03-network` (reverse proxy).
- Create n8n flows to monitor service availability and send alerts via Discord webhook.
